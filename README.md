## 📚 Arrays

An array in Java is a data structure that holds multiple values of the same type in a single variable.

### Characteristics:
- Fixed in size once declared.
- Homogeneous – stores elements of the same data type.
- Accessed via index starting from `0`.

### Types:
- **Single-Dimensional Arrays**: Linear storage of elements.
- **Multi-Dimensional Arrays**: Arrays of arrays (e.g., matrices).

Arrays are commonly used to store and manipulate collections of data efficiently.

---

## ✅ Conditional Statements

Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on decision-making conditions.

### Types:
- **if / if-else**: Executes code blocks based on a boolean condition.
- **else-if ladder**: Allows multiple conditions to be checked in sequence.
- **switch-case**: Efficiently handles multiple potential values of a variable.

Used for controlling the flow of logic in programs.

---

## 🔁 Loops

Loops are used to repeatedly execute a block of code.

### Types:
- **for loop**: Ideal when the number of iterations is known.
- **while loop**: Repeats as long as the condition is true (condition checked before execution).
- **do-while loop**: Ensures the loop body runs at least once (condition checked after execution).

Loops help with iteration, automation, and repetitive tasks in programming.

## ➕ Operators

Operators are special symbols used to perform operations on operands.

### Common Categories:
- **Arithmetic Operators**: Perform basic math (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`).
- **Relational Operators**: Compare two values (`==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, etc.).
- **Logical Operators**: Combine multiple boolean expressions (`&&`, `||`, `!`).
- **Assignment Operators**: Assign values (`=`, `+=`, `-=`, etc.).
- **Unary Operators**: Work on a single operand (`++`, `--`, etc.).
- **Bitwise Operators**: Operate on bits (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`).

Operators form the foundation of all expressions in Java.

## 🔄 Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows a single entity (like a method or object) to take multiple forms.

### Types:
- **Compile-Time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)**: Same method name with different parameters.
- **Run-Time Polymorphism (Method Overriding)**: A subclass redefines a method from its superclass.

Polymorphism is key to achieving flexibility and extensibility in object-oriented design.

What is an Array in Java?


An array in Java is a container object that holds a fixed number of values of a single type.

🧱 Key Characteristics:
Fixed Size: Once an array is created, its size cannot be changed.

Homogeneous: It stores elements of the same data type.

Indexed: Index starts from 0.

🧪 Declaring and Initializing Arrays
1. Single-Dimensional Array

int[] numbers = new int[5]; // declaration + memory allocation
numbers[0] = 10;            // assigning values
numbers[1] = 20;
// ...

// or shorthand initialization
int[] nums = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};


2. Accessing Array Elements
System.out.println(nums[2]); // prints 30

🔁 Iterating Over Arrays
Using for Loop

for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    System.out.println(nums[i]);
}

Using for-each Loop

for(int num : nums) {
    System.out.println(num);
}

🧩 Multidimensional Arrays
1. 2D Array Declaration
int[][] matrix = new int[3][3]; // 3 rows, 3 columns
matrix[0][0] = 1; // Assigning value
2. 2D Array Initialization
int[][] matrix = {
    {1, 2, 3},
    {4, 5, 6},
    {7, 8, 9}
};
3. Iterating 2D Arrays
for(int i = 0; i < matrix.length; i++) {
    for(int j = 0; j < matrix[i].length; j++) {
        System.out.print(matrix[i][j] + " ");
    }
    System.out.println();
}
🧰 Useful Array Utilities
Java provides utility methods in the java.util.Arrays class:
import java.util.Arrays;

int[] arr = {5, 2, 8, 1};
Arrays.sort(arr); // sort the array

System.out.println(Arrays.toString(arr)); // [1, 2, 5, 8]

# Conditional Statements in Java

Conditional statements are a fundamental concept in programming, allowing the execution of different parts of code based on specific conditions. In Java, there are several ways to implement conditional logic, including the `if`, `if-else`, `else-if`, and `switch` statements. These allow a program to make decisions based on the evaluation of boolean expressions.

## 1. `if` Statement

The `if` statement is used to evaluate a boolean expression (an expression that results in `true` or `false`). If the expression evaluates to `true`, the block of code inside the `if` statement will be executed. Otherwise, it is skipped.

### Key Points:
- It checks a single condition.
- If the condition is `true`, the corresponding block of code is executed.
- If the condition is `false`, the code is skipped.

## 2. `if-else` Statement

The `if-else` statement is an extension of the `if` statement. It allows the program to execute one block of code if the condition is `true`, and another block if the condition is `false`.

### Key Points:
- If the condition evaluates to `true`, the code inside the `if` block executes.
- If the condition evaluates to `false`, the code inside the `else` block executes.

## 3. `else-if` Ladder

An `else-if` ladder is used when there are multiple conditions to evaluate. It allows the program to test several conditions sequentially. If the first condition is `false`, the program moves to the next `else-if` condition and continues until it finds a `true` condition or reaches the `else` block.

### Key Points:
- Multiple conditions can be evaluated one after the other.
- Each condition is checked in sequence.
- If none of the conditions are `true`, the `else` block is executed (if it exists).

## 4. `switch` Statement

The `switch` statement is an alternative to using multiple `if-else` conditions when comparing the same variable or expression to different values. It evaluates an expression and compares its value to predefined `case` values. The code corresponding to the first matching `case` is executed.

### Key Points:
- Useful when you need to check a single variable against multiple values.
- Each `case` represents a potential match.
- The `default` case is optional and executes if no matches are found.

## Comparison of Conditional Statements

- **`if`**: Best suited for simple, single-condition checks.
- **`if-else`**: Useful when you need an alternative action when the condition is false.
- **`else-if`**: Ideal for evaluating multiple conditions in sequence.
- **`switch`**: Best for comparing a single variable against multiple fixed values.

## Conclusion

Conditional statements allow Java programs to make decisions and choose different execution paths based on varying conditions. Mastering the use of `if`, `if-else`, `else-if`, and `switch` is crucial for writing dynamic, flexible programs that can respond appropriately to different situations and inputs.

Understanding the behavior and proper application of these statements will enhance the control flow in your programs and help manage complex logic.

# Loops, Operators, and Polymorphism in Java

In Java, **loops**, **operators**, and **polymorphism** are fundamental concepts that play an essential role in building efficient and flexible programs. This document provides an overview of these key concepts and their theoretical underpinnings in Java.

## 1. Loops

A loop is a control structure that allows a set of instructions to be executed repeatedly based on a condition. Loops are used when you want to perform an operation multiple times without writing repetitive code.

### Types of Loops in Java:

- **For Loop**: Executes a block of code a fixed number of times based on a specified condition. It is useful when the number of iterations is known beforehand.
  
- **While Loop**: Repeats a block of code as long as a condition is true. It is useful when the number of iterations is not known in advance, and the loop continues until the condition becomes false.

- **Do-While Loop**: Similar to the `while` loop, but it guarantees that the loop body will be executed at least once, as the condition is checked after the block of code executes.

### Key Points:
- Loops allow for repetitive execution of code.
- Each type of loop has its specific use cases, depending on how the termination condition is defined.
- Loops improve code efficiency by reducing redundancy.

## 2. Operators


Operators are special symbols in Java that are used to perform operations on variables and values. Java provides a variety of operators to manipulate data and control flow in a program.

### Types of Operators in Java:

- **Arithmetic Operators**: Used to perform mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.
  
- **Relational Operators**: Used to compare two values and determine their relationship (greater than, less than, equal to, etc.).

- **Logical Operators**: Used to perform logical operations, usually with boolean values, such as AND, OR, and NOT.

- **Assignment Operators**: Used to assign values to variables. The most common is the `=` operator, but there are also shorthand operators like `+=`, `-=`, etc.

- **Unary Operators**: Used to perform operations on a single operand, such as incrementing or decrementing a variable.

- **Ternary Operator**: A shorthand for `if-else` that evaluates a boolean expression and returns one of two values depending on the result.

### Key Points:
- Operators are used to manipulate and compare data.
- They form the core of decision-making and calculations in Java programs.
- Java offers a rich set of operators to handle a variety of tasks.

## 3. Polymorphism

Polymorphism is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It refers to the ability of an object to take on multiple forms. In Java, polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, particularly when using inheritance.

### Types of Polymorphism:

- **Compile-Time Polymorphism (Method Overloading)**: Occurs when multiple methods have the same name but differ in the number or type of parameters. The compiler determines which method to call based on the method signature at compile time.

- **Run-Time Polymorphism (Method Overriding)**: Occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. The method that gets executed is determined at runtime based on the object's actual type.

### Key Points:
- Polymorphism allows for flexibility in code by enabling the use of a single interface to represent different underlying forms.
- It promotes reusability and ease of maintenance by allowing methods to behave differently based on the object calling them.
- Polymorphism is heavily used in Java’s OOP design to achieve abstraction and improve code organization.

## Conclusion

Understanding **loops**, **operators**, and **polymorphism** is essential for writing effective and maintainable Java programs. These concepts allow developers to create programs that are efficient, flexible, and able to handle complex logic and user inputs. Mastering these foundational elements is key to becoming proficient in Java development.
